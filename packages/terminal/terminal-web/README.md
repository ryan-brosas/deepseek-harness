# @monotykamary/dsh-terminal-web

Host Consumer that exposes Agent-owned persistent terminals to the same-origin Web client at `/api/terminal`. It registers a full-duplex WebSocket upgrade through `ctx.connection`, so Host/Origin checks and optional identity admission run before this package receives a socket. Every operation resolves the selected Agent and delegates authorization to the Host `ctx.terminals` registry; browser clients cannot attach terminal sessions created for model tools.

## Operations and framing

A new socket starts with one JSON text handshake: `list`, `open`, `attach`, or `kill`. `open` creates a placement-named native interactive login shell in the selected Session cwd and forwards the requested initial grid; `list` returns only terminals owned by that browser placement. Any number of sockets may attach the same PTY: each receives bounded replay plus live output, input is ordered across viewers, and the most recently interactive viewer controls the shared PTY grid. An attached socket carries UTF-8 terminal input as binary client frames, raw PTY output as binary Host frames, and `resize`, `kill`, `ready`, `output-frame-start`, `output-frame-end`, `exit`, `pong`, or failure controls as JSON text frames. Closing a socket detaches only that viewer and does not terminate the persistent process.

Output uses LocalTerm's two-millisecond trailing idle window and a continuous-burst bound: each kernel fragment resets the idle timer, 65,536 bytes flush immediately, and a partial stream flushes within `outputStreamThresholdMs`. A redraw that crosses the byte cap opens `output-frame-start`, sends each transport chunk in order, and closes with `output-frame-end` at the trailing idle edge, so the browser commits the complete redraw as one xterm parse transaction; a burst that reaches `outputStreamThresholdMs` closes its bracket and resumes progressive delivery. Browser attachments retain at most 16 MiB for one staged frame and disconnect on overflow. The sender retains immutable stream buffers without an intermediate copy. A slow browser is disconnected before the WebSocket queue exceeds `maxBufferedBytes`; input size, handshake time, and PTY dimensions are bounded at the wire parser. The shared terminal operation queue starts idle input synchronously, preserves FIFO order across asynchronous providers and viewers, and lets plugin disposal await quiescence.

## Configuration

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `backendType` | `shell` | `ctx.terminals` backend used by `open`. |
| `maxInputBytes` | 65,536 | Maximum bytes in one client input/control frame. |
| `outputBatchBytes` | 65,536 | Maximum bytes combined before immediate output flush. |
| `outputBatchWindowMs` | 2 | Trailing idle delay for a partial output batch. |
| `outputStreamThresholdMs` | 100 | Maximum duration for a continuous partial output burst. |
| `maxBufferedBytes` | 4,194,304 | WebSocket queue limit before disconnect. |
| `handshakeTimeoutMs` | 10,000 | First-frame deadline. |
| `maxCols` / `maxRows` | 1,000 | Accepted PTY dimension limits. |

## Model Experience

None, as this browser transport adds no model-visible input or output.

#### KV Cache effect

None; WebSocket input bypasses model requests.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- Terminal bytes and attachments remain process-local; a Host restart ends every browser terminal.
- The wire sends raw output without application-level compression.
- One socket attaches one terminal; sharing one PTY across viewers uses independent sockets rather than multiplexing several PTYs over one socket.
